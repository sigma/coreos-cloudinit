[Unit]
Description=Watch for an ovfenv at /media/ovfenv

# Note: This unit is essentially just here as a fall-back mechanism to
# trigger cloudinit if it isn't triggered explicitly by other means
# such as by a Wants= in the mount unit. This ensures we handle the
# case where /media/ovfenv is provided to a CoreOS container.
